# The Raindance Project

Over the years, we all collect skills in building up attacks and details to help defend and ruggedize our software.  The goal of this project is to figure out how to simplify attack modeling for developers.  And to take on the challenge of making it possible to achieve a good amount of attack modeling within 15 minutes in order to fit within a continuous delivery process.

## Hypothesis

Using github and developing a common components model, we think we can solve for a just enough attack modeling approach that makes it possible to create a better security understanding and strategy for most applications.

## Approach

Raindance builds upon the concept that software projects should contain security information and a common understanding of attack surface.  In a software project that employs this methodology, you would find a SECURITY.md and ATTACKS.md file within the root of the project.  Focusing in on the ATTACKS.md file, we believe it is necessary to include a thumbnail sketch along with attacks that have been considered during the design, implementation and operations of the software project.  Further Raindance is meant to provide a library for commonly implemented patterns and the potential pitfalls that should be considered in order to reduce the effort and time required to identify an attack model.
