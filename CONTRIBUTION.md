## Contributing
Raindance is in early stages of being developed by a core team of people who are researching the best ways to accomplish the mission.  We are aware that it looks a bit messy right now as we are assembling the parts and figuring out how to scale our efforts across our community. Raindance can certainly use some additional collaboration.  We're using Slack to start working on this during our free time.  All help is welcome and please realize we are learning how to Open Source, so please be patient with us.

### A. How to help
We are using Omnigraffle and Markdown to start the decomposition of components and to build out the domains. If you want to help there are two avenues:

1. Fork this repo, submit issues and send in pull requests.
2. Reach out to any of the principal contacts on the devsecops.org site.

Work on this project will be slow at first and then it is intended to ramp up over time.  We are also working with some folks that are involved in the [DevSecOps Bootcamp](https://github.com/devsecops/bootcamp)

### B. Where to begin?
We are beginning with External attack surface first and then moving into Internal and Privileged work.  We think this approach will help other folks to adopt sooner and will enable others within the community to assist because of common context.  If you'd like to help us, we think the best place to start is here: [external](patterns/external/README.md)

### C. Working with other projects
We are really interested in partnering with other projects that have established common bodies of knowledge.  Our intention is to create a collaborative environment and not a replacement model for other efforts. We have a few open source projects (CAPEC, etc.) identified already and intend to work with them early in this project.
