# Attack Model: Basic 3-Tier Website / Same Subnet

## Description
An externally available basic website is generally constructed from a core set of components and in many cases is supported by a 2 or 3 tier architecture.  Commonly, a basic website contains a web server, app server and database. In this configuration, the website is configured to share the same subnet with external access through the web server.

## Scope / Dependencies
A typical basic website use case consists of a marketing or blog site with limited to no dependencies.  In this configuration, we are not evaluating the potential for 3rd party integration.
