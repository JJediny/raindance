# External Attack Taxonomy

This document contains top-level taxonomy for targets, attacks and mitigations that have been classified as external options.  We are intentionally reducing complexity in our approach at the top level to make it possible to create attack models in as little as 15 minutes.  

It is a work in progress and will continue to evolve as we grow this framework.  Our intention is to make use of other methods and information available to help make this system work for quick attack modeling.
