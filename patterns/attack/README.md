This section provides a collection of attacks and kill-chain steps that aid in compromise of organizational assets.

* #### [Reconnaissance]()

	Reconnaissance is the act of collecting information to uncover weaknesses or relationships between assets which could be exploited.  This is a preliminary step for most attacks and helps an adversary to uncover a successful attack strategy.

* #### [Testing]()

	Information from reconnaissance often needs to be tested to confirm whether a weakness exists.  Adversaries need to probe to gather details for their attack.  Asset ownership and organizational boundaries can help to surface an attackers tests or help to hide them.
