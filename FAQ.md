#Raindance FAQ

###1. Where can I get info about creating attack files to reference?

You can check out the DevSecOps Firebolt project.  We are working with some Open Source projects and Vendors to develop .attack capabilities.


###2. When are you meeting to discuss progress?

We are working via Slack and meeting once a week to work on Raindance.  

###3. Why not just use Threat Modeling?

We've determined that Threat Modeling is too static and requires a lot of effort and context to get right.  It also doesn't quite fit into Continuous Delivery.  And we are concerned that when a threat model isn't done well, it's hard to determine.
